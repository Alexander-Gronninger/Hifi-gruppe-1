              Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall affect the Buyer’s
              statutory rights as a Consumer. These Terms and Conditions shall
              apply to all contracts for the sale of Goods by the Seller to the
              Buyer and shall prevail over any other documentation or
              communication from the Buyer. Acceptance of delivery of the Goods
              shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the Buyer’s acceptance of
              these Terms and Conditions. Any variation to these Terms and
              Conditions (including any special terms and conditions agreed
              between the parties) shall be inapplicable unless agreed in
              writing by the Seller. Any complaints should be addressed to the
              Seller’s address above.

              the Buyer shall be notified and given the option to either wait

              All effort has been made to ensure that photography, descriptions
              and details are correct and accurate. Due to constraints in

              slightly from actual products. All measurements are approximate.
              The Seller will not be liable for any consequential loss or damage
              arising should the Buyer rely on the accuracy of the digitally
