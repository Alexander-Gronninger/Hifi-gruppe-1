                Established in the late 1960s, our family owned business is
                based in Edinburgh and Falkirk, but services customers across
                the UK.
              </h3>
              <p class="ourHistory__text">
                Our Edinburgh branch has the longest history as an audio
                retailer in the UK. During recent renovations, receipts were
                found from Nicolson’s Gramophone Saloon dating back to 1926. In
                the 1950s WG Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG
                Graham’s Hi-Fi Corner. Upon his retirement, Graham Tiso bought
                the business and shortened the name to Hi-Fi Corner.
              </p>
              <p class="ourHistory__text">
                Soon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who
                was recommended by Linn’s own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to
                manage the shop; with a knack for business and years of
                experience in the hi-fi industry, Colin would later become the
                owner of Hi-Fi Corner. Today, Struan MacKenzie carries on the
                legacy as the company’s Managing Director.
